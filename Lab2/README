# Lab 2: The Illusion of Growth & The Composition Effect

## Objective

Built a Python pipeline to ingest live economic data from the Federal Reserve API (FRED) to analyze wage stagnation and correct for statistical biases in labor market indicators. This project investigates the "Money Illusion" phenomenon and uncovers how composition effects can create misleading narratives about economic progress.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **fredapi** - Federal Reserve Economic Data API client
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and time series analysis
- **matplotlib** - Data visualization

## Methodology
