# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional economic theory with cutting-edge data science methodologies.

## About This Portfolio

As an undergraduate economics student, I'm building skills at the intersection of **causal inference** and **predictive analytics**—two paradigms that are transforming how we understand economic phenomena. This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:

- Apply classical econometric techniques to real-world problems
- Scale foundational statistical concepts using modern machine learning algorithms
- Translate economic theory into data-driven insights

The coursework follows a **"Concept Extension"** philosophy: we start with core statistical methods (like OLS regression) and expand them using ML algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods). This approach equips me to tackle both explanatory and predictive challenges in economics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This portfolio leverages industry-standard tools for economic data analysis:
